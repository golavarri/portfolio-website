            The emphasis of a Digital Fabrication course I took was on software-driven object making. 
            We created these pencil boxes with the CNC and laser printer by creating a CNC carving path 
            with VCarve and designing a pattern for the outside of the box with Adobe Illustrator. 
            This was also an introductory practice in laser engraving on a multi-sided object.

            For an Interdisciplinary Project Design course, I created a Dr. Pepper inspired lampshade 
            as an exploration of various fabrication techniques. We were tasked with creating a simple 
            cylindrical lithophane lampshade, but I wanted to push beyond this straightforward shape to
            create something that more closely emulated the real object. I was drawn to the shape of a
            soda can – still cylindrical, but with a slightly more compelling silhouette. My mom’s 
            favorite soda is Diet Dr. Pepper so the lamp is ultimately an homage to her. \n

            The final product is a culmination of work across several software tools including Solidworks, 
            VCarve, and Adobe Illustrator to develop the components of the lamp. I designed a 3D model of 
            the body of the lamp in Solidworks and printed multiple drafts of the body in different colors 
            of filament. In doing so, I learned that the settings for the print such as the temperature and
            layer height have a strong correlation with the opacity, texture, and overall aesthetic of the
            print. I used VCarve to create a file to use with the CNC to carve the wooden base of the lamp, 
            and carve the circuit pattern into a copper plate to create the circuit board.

            As the first project in Introduction to Mechanical Design and Engineering, we were tasked with 
            creating a cube with any design on it. We used SolidWorks to create the cube, designing one cube 
            face, duplicating the sides, and assembling the box in the software for visualization purposes. 
            I used Adobe Illustrator to create a cow design that I laser engraved into each of the box faces.

            As the first project in an Interdisciplinary Project Lab course, we were tasked with creating 
            a lampshade entirely out of a single type of paper and a single type of glue. As I was exploring 
            the medium, I became curious about how I could manipulate the flat surface of the paper to offer 
            the illusion of space and vastness. I played with creating depth through layering, bending, and 
            folding the paper to create shadows and different refractions of light. Through testing the limits 
            of the medium, I was drawn to the idea of creating an aquarium, making the lampshade feel like a 
            self-contained, yet spacious underwater ecosystem. I explored various methods of cutting out paper 
            and layering the paper to create a water-like refraction of light from the top and bottom of the 
            lampshade. The final materials used were a semi-heavy stock paper and rubber cement to create the 
            lampshade, utilizing both hand and laser cutting techniques.

            I wanted to learn how to use the 3D scanner and attempt to create a hollow print of a hand in 
            order to make it into a lampshade. I was particularly interested in how well the scanner could 
            pick up organic shapes like a human body part because it is difficult to 3D model such forms from 
            scratch. I used a 3D scanner housed in the College of Design & Engineering’s primary lab in order 
            to get a rough scan of my friend’s hand and then edited the 3D model in Blender. Because of the nature 
            of the scan, the model’s mesh was quite irregular and not suited for hollow printing. However, the 
            resulting solid print closely replicated the human form. I have created many 3D models, but predominantly 
            models created out of more regular, geometric shapes. I learned that the 3D scanner is a valuable tool to 
            ease the process of developing complex models from irregular shapes.

            On the first day of a Digital Fabrication course I took, we were given machines to deconstruct. Our 
            objective was to find a component within the machine that appealed to our design or creative sensibilities. 
            I was intrigued by this metal motor because of the way the different textures of the constituent parts of it 
            and the way they all fit together perfectly, like a puzzle. We did an orthographic study of the object, capturing 
            the view of the object from every angle. Then, we developed and printed a 3D model of the object.

            As the final self-directed project for an Information Security & Privacy course, I developed a web application for 
            detecting the probability of phishing in social media direct messages. Our goal with the project was to create a 
            user-friendly tool that made privacy practices more accessible for social media users who may be more vulnerable 
            or inexperienced with online scams. When a user receives a suspicious message via direct message or left as a 
            comment on their social media page, the user can enter the in the primary page of the web application. Once entering
            the message, the user is directed to a search landing page that breaks down the probability that the message is 
            either phishing, a scam, or a non-threatening ham message and offers some advice on action steps the user can 
            take. 

            I built out the application using React, a front-end Javascript library for building user interfaces, and designed 
            the logo for the site in Procreate on a tablet. This was a particularly compelling project because I had the 
            opportunity to connect various passions of mine including digital design and frontend development, with my 
            technical programming practice.

            For my final project in an Interdisciplinary Project Lab course, we had the opportunity to delve into a self-directed
             project in which we explored light in some capacity. My partner and I were particularly interested in creating a 
             light display with an interactive element. We played off of the idea of how art is subjective – we wanted to be 
             able to display an interpretation of the “beholder’s” eyes in our light display so each person looking at the 
             installation would have a unique encounter with the piece. I developed an iOS application that took a photo of a 
             user’s eyes using Apple’s Vision framework. When a user’s face is in focus, the app automatically detects the 
             user’s eyes and displays them in small boxes. The user can then save the image to their device. The application 
             filters the eye image data captured in the image and converts the colors to that which can be displayed by standard 
             RGB LEDs. The color data is then displayed by the LED sculpture.

            In a biodegradable design course, I created a mycelium-based golf tee as an exploration of the functional applications 
            of growing mycelium, the root system of mushrooms, through a process of compression. I initially got the idea for this 
            project from talking to my dad – an avid golfer. I was excited by the idea of finding ways to make a non-eco friendly 
            yet overwhelmingly popular activity like golf more sustainable.

            I modeled an initial tee design in Rhino and took the boolean difference with a rectangle to create a mold for the 
            mycelium to grow in. I 3D printed the design in corn PLA. I grew several prototypes of the design over the span of a 
            semester and went through various redesign iterations. Throughout this process, I learned a lot about the notion of 
            designing versus engineering a product. With my initial designs, I was considering how a golf tee looks and how I 
            could recreate that. But as I continued to iterate, I began to consider how the fairly simple form of the golf tee 
            needs to work and how to recreate that functionality given the material constraints of working with an organic 
            material like mycelium.
